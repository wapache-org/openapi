## Describing Request Body

Request bodies are typically used with “create” and “update” operations  (POST, PUT, PATCH). 
For example, when creating a resource using POST or PUT, the request body usually contains the representation of the resource to be created. 
OpenAPI 3.0 provides the `requestBody` keyword to describe request bodies. 

### Differences From OpenAPI 2.0

If you used OpenAPI 2.0 before, here is a summary of changes to help you get started with OpenAPI 3.0:

- Body and form parameters are replaced with `requestBody`.
- Operations can now consume both form data and other media types such as JSON. 
- The `consumes` array is replaced with the `requestBody.content` map which maps the media types to their schemas.
- Schemas can vary by media type.
- `anyOf` and `oneOf` can be used to specify alternate schemas.
- Form data can now contain objects, and you can specify the serialization strategy for objects and arrays.
- GET, DELETE and HEAD are no longer allowed to have request body because it does not have defined semantics as per [RFC 7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3).

### requestBody, content and Media Types

Unlike OpenAPI 2.0, where the request body was defined using `body` and `formData` parameters, OpenAPI 3.0 uses the ~~~~`requestBody` keyword to distinguish the payload from [parameters](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/describing-parameters/) (such as query string). 
The `requestBody` is more flexible in that it lets you consume different media types,  such as JSON, XML, form data, plain text, and others, and use different  schemas for different media types. `requestBody` consists of the `content` object, an optional [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/)-formatted `description`, and an optional `required` flag (`false` by default). 
`content` lists the media types consumed by the operation (such as `application/json`) and specifies the `schema` for each media type. 
**Request bodies are optional by default**. To mark the body as required, use `required: true`.~~~~

```yaml
paths:
  /pets:
    post:
      summary: Add a new pet

      requestBody:
        description: Optional description in *Markdown*
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/Pet'
          application/xml:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/Pet'
          application/x-www-form-urlencoded:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/PetForm'
          text/plain:
            schema:
              type: string

      responses:
        '201':
          description: Created
```

`content` allows wildcard media types. 
For example, `image/*` represents all image types; 
`*/*` represents all types and is functionally equivalent to `application/octet-stream`. 
Specific media types have preference over wildcard media types when interpreting the spec, for example, `image/png` > `image/*` > `*/*`.

```yaml
paths:
  /avatar:
    put:
      summary: Upload an avatar
      requestBody:
        content:
          image/*:    # Can be image/png, image/svg, image/gif, etc.
            schema:
              type: string
              format: binary
```

### anyOf, oneOf

OpenAPI 3.0 supports `anyOf` and `oneOf`, so you can specify alternate schemas for the request body:

```yaml
requestBody:
  description: A JSON object containing pet information
  content:
    application/json:
      schema:
        oneOf:
          - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Cat'
          - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Dog'
          - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Hamster'
```

### File Upload

To learn how to describe file upload, see [File Upload](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/describing-request-body/file-upload/) and [Multipart Requests](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/describing-request-body/multipart-requests/).

### Request Body Examples

The request body can have an `example` or multiple `examples`. 
`example` and `examples` are properties of the `requestBody.content.<media-type>` object. 
If provided, these examples override the examples provided by  the schema. 
This is handy, for example, if the request and response use  the same schema but you want to have different examples. 
`example` allows a single inline example:

```yaml
requestBody:
  content:
    application/json:
      schema:
        $ref: '#/components/schemas/Pet'
      example:
        name: Fluffy
        petType: dog
```

The `examples` (plural) are more flexible – you can have an inline example, a `$ref` reference, or point to an external URL containing the payload example. 
Each example can also have optional `summary` and `description` for documentation purposes.

```yaml
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/Pet'
            examples:

              dog:  # <--- example name
                summary: An example of a dog
                value:
                  # vv Actual payload goes here vv
                  name: Fluffy
                  petType: dog

              cat:  # <--- example name
                summary: An example of a cat
                externalValue: http://api.example.com/examples/cat.json   # cat.json contains {"name": "Tiger", "petType": "cat"}

              hamster:  # <--- example name
                $ref: '#/components/examples/hamster'

components:
  examples:
    hamster:  # <--- example name
      summary: An example of a hamster
      value:
        # vv Actual payload goes here vv
        name: Ginger
        petType: hamster
```

See [Adding Examples](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/adding-examples/) for more information.

### Reusable Bodies

You can put the request body definitions in the global `components.requestBodies` section and `$ref` them elsewhere. 
This is handy if multiple operations have the same request body – this way you can reuse the same definition easily. 

```yaml
paths:
  /pets:
    post:
      summary: Add a new pet
      requestBody:
        $ref: '#/components/requestBodies/PetBody'

  /pets/{petId}
    put:
      summary: Update a pet
      parameters: [ ... ]
      requestBody:
        $ref: '#/components/requestBodies/PetBody'

components:
  requestBodies:
    PetBody:
      description: A JSON object containing pet information
      required: true
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            $ref: '#/components/schemas/Pet'
```

### Form Data

The term “form data” is used for the media types `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and `multipart/form-data`, which are commonly used to submit HTML forms.

- `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` is used to send simple ASCII text data as `key=value` pairs. The payload format is similar to [query parameters](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/describing-parameters/#query-parameters).
- `multipart/form-data` allows submitting binary data as  well as multiple media types in a single message (for example, image and JSON). Each form field has its own section in the payload with internal HTTP headers. `multipart` requests are commonly used for [file uploads](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/file-upload/).

To illustrate form data, consider an HTML POST form:

```xml
<form action="http://example.com/survey" method="post">
  <input type="text"   name="name" />
  <input type="number" name="fav_number" />
  <input type="submit"/>
</form>
```

This form POSTs data to the form’s endpoint:

```http request
POST /survey HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 28

name=Amy+Smith&fav_number=42
```

In OpenAPI 3.0, form data is modelled using a `type: object` schema where the object properties represent the form fields:

```yaml
paths:
  /survey:
    post:
      requestBody:
        required: true
        content:
          application/x-www-form-urlencoded:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                name:          # <!--- form field name
                  type: string
                fav_number:    # <!--- form field name
                  type: integer
              required:
                - name
                - email
```

Form fields can contain primitives values, arrays and objects. 
By default, arrays are serialized as `array_name=value1&array_name=value2` and objects as `prop1=value1&prop=value2`, but you can use other serialization strategies as defined by the  OpenAPI 3.0 Specification. 
The serialization strategy is specified in  the `encoding` section like so:

```yaml
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/x-www-form-urlencoded:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                color:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    type: string
            encoding:
              color:            # color=red,green,blue
                style: form
                explode: false
```

By default, reserved characters `:/?#[]@!$&'()*+,;=` in form field values within `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` bodies are [percent-encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) when sent. 
To allow these characters to be sent as is, use the `allowReserved` keyword like so:

```yaml
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/x-www-form-urlencoded:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                foo:
                  type: string
                bar:
                  type: string
                baz:
                  type: string
            encoding:
              # Don't percent-encode reserved characters in the values of "bar" and "baz" fields
              bar:
                allowReserved: true
              baz:
                allowReserved: true
```

Arbitrary `key=value` pairs can be modelled using a free-form schema: 

```yaml
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/x-www-form-urlencoded:
            schema:
              type: object
              additionalProperties: true    # this line is optional
```

#### Complex Serialization in Form Data

The serialization rules provided by the `style` and `explode` keywords only have defined behavior for arrays of primitives and objects with primitive properties. 
For more complex scenarios, such as  nested arrays or JSON in form data, you need to use the `contentType` keyword to specify the media type for encoding the value of a complex field. 
Consider [Slack incoming webhooks](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks) for an example. 
A message can be sent directly as JSON, or the JSON data can be sent inside a form field named `payload` like so (before URL-encoding is applied):

```
payload={"text":"Swagger is awesome"}
```

This can be described as:

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  version: 1.0.0
  title: Slack Incoming Webhook
externalDocs:
  url: https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks

servers:
  - https://hooks.slack.com

paths:
  /services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX:
    post:
      summary: Post a message to Slack
      requestBody:
        content:
        
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/Message'

          application/x-www-form-urlencoded:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                payload:     # <--- form field that contains the JSON message
                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/Message'
            encoding:
              payload:
                contentType: application/json

      responses:
        '200':
          description: OK

components:
  schemas:
    Message:
      title: A Slack message
      type: object
      properties:
        text:
          type: string
          description: Message text
      required:
        - text
```

## File Upload

In OpenAPI 3.0, you can describe files uploaded directly with the request content and files uploaded with `multipart` requests. 
Use the `requestBody` keyword to describe the request payload containing a file. 
Under `content`, specify the request media type (such as `image/png` or `application/octet-stream`). 
Files use a `type: string` schema with `format: binary` or `format: base64`, depending on how the file contents will be encoded.  
For example:

 ```yaml
 requestBody:
   content:
     image/png:
       schema:
         type: string
         format: binary
 ```

This definition corresponds to an HTTP request that looks as follows:

```http request
POST /upload
Host: example.com
Content-Length: 808
Content-Type: image/png

[file content goes there]
```

### Upload via Multipart Requests

To describe a file sent with other data, use the `multipart` media type. For example:

```yaml
      requestBody:
        content:
          multipart/form-data:
            schema:
              properties:
                orderId:
                  type: integer
                userId:
                  type: integer
                fileName:
                  type: string
                  format: binary
```

The corresponding HTTP request payload will include multiple parts:

```http request
POST /upload
Host: example.com
Content-Length: 2740
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryWfPNVh4wuWBlyEyQ

------WebKitFormBoundaryWfPNVh4wuWBlyEyQ
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="orderId"

1195
------WebKitFormBoundaryWfPNVh4wuWBlyEyQ
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="userId"

545
------WebKitFormBoundaryWfPNVh4wuWBlyEyQ
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="fileName"; filename="attachment.txt"
Content-Type: text/plain

[file content goes there]
------WebKitFormBoundaryWfPNVh4wuWBlyEyQ
```


### Multiple File Upload

Use the `multipart` media type to define uploading an arbitrary number of files (an array of files):

 ```yaml
       requestBody:
         content:
           multipart/form-data:
             schema:
               properties:
                 filename:
                   type: array
                   items:
                     type: string
                     format: binary
 ```

The corresponding HTTP request will look as follows:

```http request
POST /upload
Host: example.com
Content-Length: 2740
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryWfPNVh4wuWBlyEyQ

------WebKitFormBoundaryWfPNVh4wuWBlyEyQ
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="fileName"; filename="file1.txt"
Content-Type: text/plain

[file content goes there]
------WebKitFormBoundaryWfPNVh4wuWBlyEyQ
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="fileName"; filename="file2.png"
Content-Type: image/png

[file content goes there]

------WebKitFormBoundaryWfPNVh4wuWBlyEyQ
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="fileName"; filename="file3.jpg"
Content-Type: image/jpeg

[file content goes there]

------WebKitFormBoundaryWfPNVh4wuWBlyEyQ
```

[Considerations for File Uploads](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.3.md#considerations-for-file-uploads)

[Special Considerations for multipart Content](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.3.md#special-considerations-for-multipart-content)

## Multipart Requests

Multipart requests combine one or more sets of data into a single  body, separated by boundaries. 
You typically use these requests for file uploads and for transferring data of several types in a single request  (for example, a file along with a JSON object). 
In OpenAPI 3, you  describe a multipart request in the following way:

```yaml
requestBody:
  content: 
    multipart/form-data: # Media type
      schema: # Request payload
        type: object
        properties: # Request parts
          id: # Part 1 (string value)
            type: string
            format: uuid
          address: # Part2 (object)
            type: object
            properties:
              street:
                type: string
              city:
                type: string
          profileImage: # Part 3 (an image)
            type: string
            format: binary
```

You start with the `requestBody/content` keyword. 
Then, you specify the media type of request data. 
File uploads typically use the `*multipart/form-data*` media type, and mixed-data requests usually use `*multipart/mixed*`. 
Below the media type, put the `schema` keyword to indicate that you start describing the request payload. 
You  describe individual parts of the request as properties of the `schema` object. 
As you can see, a multipart request can include various data:  strings, objects in JSON format, and binary data. 
You can also specify  one or several files for uploading. 
(To learn more, see [File Upload](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/describing-request-body/file-upload/).) 
The example above corresponds to the following request:

```http request
POST /upload HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: 428
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryOmz20xyMCkE27rN7

------WebKitFormBoundaryOmz20xyMCkE27rN7
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="id"
Content-Type: text/plain

123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000

------WebKitFormBoundaryOmz20xyMCkE27rN7
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="address"
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "street": "3, Garden St",
  "city": "Hillsbery, UT"
}

------WebKitFormBoundaryOmz20xyMCkE27rN7
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="profileImage "; filename="image1.png"
Content-Type: application/octet-steam

{…file content…}

------WebKitFormBoundaryOmz20xyMCkE27rN7--
```

### Specifying Content-Type

By default, the `Content-Type` of individual request parts is set automatically according to the type of the `schema` properties that describe the request parts:

| Schema Property Type                      | Content-Type               |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Primitive or array of primitives          | `text/plain`               |
| Complex value or array of complex values  | `application/json`         |
| String in the `binary` or `base64` format | `application/octet-stream` |

To set a specific `Content-Type` for a request part, use the `encoding/*{property-name}*/contentType` field. 
You add `encoding` as a child of the media type property, one the same level where `schema` is located. 
In the example below, we set the `contentType` for the `profileImage` part of a multipart request to `image/png, image/jpg`:

```yaml
requestBody:
  content:
    multipart/form-data:
      schema:
        type: object
        properties: # Request parts
          id:
            type: string
            format: uuid
          address:
            type: object
            properties:
              street:
                type: string
              city:
                type: string
          profileImage:
            type: string
            format: base64
      encoding: # The same level as schema
        profileImage: # Property name (see above)
          contentType: image/png, image/jpeg
```

### Specifying Custom Headers

Parts of multipart requests usually do not use any headers, except for `Content`. 
In case you need to include custom headers, use the `encoding/*{property-name}*/headers` field to describe these headers (see below). 
For complete information on describing headers, see [Describing Parameters](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/describing-parameters/). 
Below is an example of a custom header defined for a part of a multipart request:

```yaml
requestBody:
  content:
    multipart/form-data:
      schema:
        type: object
        properties:
          id:
            type: string
            format: uuid
          profileImage:
            type: string
            format: binary
      encoding:
        profileImage: # Property name
          contentType: image/png, image/jpeg
          headers: # Custom headers
            X-Custom-Header:
              description: This is a custom header
              schema:
                type: string
```

This declaration matches the following request:

```http request
POST /upload HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: 428
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryOmz20xyMCkE27rN7

------WebKitFormBoundaryOmz20xyMCkE27rN7
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="id"
Content-Type: text/plain

123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000

------WebKitFormBoundaryOmz20xyMCkE27rN7
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="profileImage"; filename="image1.png"
Content-Type: image/png
X-Custom-Header: x-header

{…file content…}
```
