## Basic Structure

You can write OpenAPI definitions in [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) or [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON). 
In this guide, we use only YAML examples but JSON works equally well. 
A sample OpenAPI 3.0 definition written in YAML looks like:

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Sample API
  description: Optional multiline or single-line description in [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/help/) or HTML.
  version: 0.1.9
 
servers:
  - url: http://api.example.com/v1
    description: Optional server description, e.g. Main (production) server
  - url: http://staging-api.example.com
    description: Optional server description, e.g. Internal staging server for testing
 
paths:
  /users:
    get:
      summary: Returns a list of users.
      description: Optional extended description in CommonMark or HTML.
      responses:
        '200':    # status code
          description: A JSON array of user names
          content:
            application/json:
              schema: 
                type: array
                items: 
                  type: string
```

All keyword names are **case-sensitive**.

### Metadata

Every API definition must include the version of the OpenAPI Specification that this definition is based on:

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
```

The OpenAPI version defines the overall structure of an API definition – what you can document and how you document it.  
OpenAPI 3.0 uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) with a three-part version number. 
The [available versions](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/releases) are `3.0.0`, `3.0.1`, `3.0.2`, and `3.0.3`; they are functionally the same.

The `info` section contains API information: `title`, `description` (optional), `version`:

```yaml
info:
  title: Sample API
  description: Optional multiline or single-line description in [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/help/) or HTML.
  version: 0.1.9
```

 * `title` is your API name. 
 * `description` is extended information about your API. It can be [multiline](http://stackoverflow.com/a/21699210) and supports the [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/help/) dialect of Markdown for rich text representation. HTML is supported to the extent provided by CommonMark (see [HTML Blocks](http://spec.commonmark.org/0.27/) in [CommonMark 0.27 Specification](http://spec.commonmark.org/0.27/)). 
 * `version` is an arbitrary string that specifies the version of your API (do not confuse it with file revision or the `openapi` version). You can use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) like *major.minor.patch*, or an arbitrary string like *1.0-beta* or *2017-07-25*. 
 * `info` also supports other keywords for contact information, license, terms of service, and other details.

Reference: [Info Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.3.md#infoObject).

### Servers

The `servers` section specifies the API server and base URL. 
You can define one or several servers, such as production and sandbox.

```yaml
servers:
  - url: http://api.example.com/v1
    description: Optional server description, e.g. Main (production) server
  - url: http://staging-api.example.com
    description: Optional server description, e.g. Internal staging server for testing
```

All API paths are relative to the server URL. 
In the example above, `/users` means `http://api.example.com/v1/users` or `http://staging-api.example.com/users`, depending on the server used.  
For more information, see [API Server and Base Path](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/api-host-and-base-path/). 

### Paths

The `paths` section defines individual endpoints (paths)  in your API, and the HTTP methods (operations) supported by these  endpoints. For example, `GET /users` can be described as:

```yaml
paths:
  /users:
    get:
      summary: Returns a list of users.
      description: Optional extended description in CommonMark or HTML
      responses:
        '200':
          description: A JSON array of user names
          content:
            application/json:
              schema: 
                type: array
                items: 
                  type: string
```

An operation definition includes parameters, request body (if any),  possible response status codes (such as 200 OK or 404 Not Found) and  response contents.  
For more information, see [Paths and Operations](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/paths-and-operations/). 

### Parameters

Operations can have parameters passed via URL path (`/users/{userId}`), query string (`/users?role=admin`), headers (`X-CustomHeader: Value`) or cookies (`Cookie: debug=0`). 
You can define the parameter data types, format, whether they are required or optional, and other details:

```yaml
paths:
  /user/{userId}:
    get:
      summary: Returns a user by ID.
      parameters:
        - name: userId
          in: path
          required: true
          description: Parameter description in CommonMark or HTML.
          schema:
            type : integer
            format: int64
            minimum: 1
      responses: 
        '200':
          description: OK
```

For more information, see [Describing Parameters](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/describing-parameters/). 

### Request Body

If an operation sends a request body, use the `requestBody` keyword to describe the body content and media type.

```yaml
paths:
  /users:
    post:
      summary: Creates a user.
      requestBody:
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                username:
                  type: string
      responses: 
        '201':
          description: Created
```

For more information, see [Describing Request Body](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/describing-request-body/).

### Responses

For each operation, you can define possible status codes, such as 200 OK or 404 Not Found, and the response body `schema`. 
Schemas can be defined inline or referenced via [`$ref`](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/using-ref/).  
You can also provide example responses for different content types:

```yaml
paths:
  /user/{userId}:
    get:
      summary: Returns a user by ID.
      parameters:
        - name: userId
          in: path
          required: true
          description: The ID of the user to return.
          schema:
            type: integer
            format: int64
            minimum: 1
      responses:
        '200':
          description: A user object.
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  id:
                    type: integer
                    format: int64
                    example: 4
                  name:
                    type: string
                    example: Jessica Smith
        '400':
          description: The specified user ID is invalid (not a number).
        '404':
          description: A user with the specified ID was not found.
        default:
          description: Unexpected error
```

Note that the response HTTP status codes must be enclosed in quotes: "200" (OpenAPI 2.0 did not require this).  
For more information, see [Describing Responses](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/describing-responses/).

### Input and Output Models

The global `components/schemas` section lets you define common data structures used in your API. 
They can be referenced via `$ref` whenever a `schema` is required – in parameters, request bodies, and response bodies. 
For example, this JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": 4,
  "name": "Arthur Dent"
}
```

can be represented as:

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    User:
      properties:
        id:
          type: integer
        name:
          type: string
      # Both properties are required
      required:  
        - id
        - name
```

and then referenced in the request body schema and response body schema as follows:

```yaml
paths:
  /users/{userId}:
    get:
      summary: Returns a user by ID.
      parameters:
        - in: path
          name: userId
          required: true
          type: integer
      responses:
        '200':
          description: OK
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'
  /users:
    post:
      summary: Creates a new user.
      requestBody:
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'
      responses:
        '201':
          description: Created
```

### Authentication

The `securitySchemes` and `security` keywords are used to describe the authentication methods used in your API.

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    BasicAuth:
      type: http
      scheme: basic
 
security:
  - BasicAuth: []
```

Supported authentication methods are:

- HTTP authentication: [Basic](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/basic-authentication/), [Bearer](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/), and so on.
- [API key](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/api-keys/) as a header or query parameter or in cookies
- [OAuth 2](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/oauth2/)
- [OpenID Connect Discovery](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/openid-connect-discovery/)

For more information, see [Authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/).
